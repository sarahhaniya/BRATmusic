# BRATmusic
Developed a Spotify-like music database application, BRATmusic, from conceptual model design through to a relational schema, identifying schema flaws and normalizing the database for optimal performance.
Created and evaluated a logical database model, addressing schema flaws, opportunities for combining relations, and achieving BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) compliance to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
Planned web application functionality with a minimum of six unique user actions, supporting complex SQL queries with joins, subqueries, and aggregations for diverse music-related data retrieval.
Next phase includes building a web application with an SQL backend to simulate real-world functionalities of a music streaming service, providing users with a responsive and interactive interface.
